# FroggerReplicaUnity
This project builds a replica of the game "Frogger".  The user moves the frog up across the 'road' to the other side while avoiding oncoming traffic.  The user can move in four directions using the arrow keys.  When the frog gets hit by a car, the game resets and the score is set to zero.  When the frog reaches the other side (the top) the game resets and 100 is added to the score.  There are 4 rows of traffic and spawns cars at random-frequencies.  When the cars move off screen, the game objects are destroyed to not clutter the object-hierarchy. Enjoy!
